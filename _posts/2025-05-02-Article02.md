title: Source-available vs Open source & AI Software Licensing

# 1) Source-available vs Open source

### Q: What is meant by "source-available" licenses?

**A:** "Source-available" licenses provide access to software's source code but include restrictions on use, modification, or distribution not found in OSI-approved open-source licenses. These often limit commercial activities or specific applications, meaning users don't receive all the freedoms defined by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).

### Q: Find some examples of licenses that are "source available", but don't meet the "OSI Open Source Definition".

**A:** Two examples of non-OSI-approved "source-available" licenses are:

1.  **Commons Clause:** An add-on to open-source licenses that restricts "selling" the software. Its addition makes the license source-available but not open source due to this commercial limitation.
2.  **TrueCrypt License:** Used for the TrueCrypt disk encryption tool, this license was not OSI-approved. It contained clauses seen as overly restrictive, including potential limitations on program execution and trademark conditions.

### Q: What clauses do they violate? (Refer to The Open Source Definition: https://opensource.org/osd)

**A:** These licenses primarily violate the following OSI Open Source Definition clauses:

*   **Commons Clause:**
    *   Violates **OSD Clause 1 (Free Redistribution)** by restricting software sales.
    *   Violates **OSD Clause 6 (No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor)** by limiting commercial sales activities.

*   **TrueCrypt License:**
    *   Potentially violates **OSD Clause 5 (No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups)** or **OSD Clause 6 (No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor)** through restrictions on program execution.
    *   Can conflict with **OSD Clause 1 (Free Redistribution)** and **OSD Clause 3 (Derived Works)** due to restrictive conditions on redistribution and derivative creation.

# 2) Artificial Intelligence software

### Q: What are OpenRAILs licenses trying to do? (See the Hugging Face reading above (Section 6.1))

**A:** OpenRAIL (Responsible AI Licenses) aim to foster responsible AI development and use by granting broad permissions typical of open access but uniquely embedding specific **use-based restrictions**. These restrictions are designed to prevent AI models/code from being used in harmful or unethical ways as defined in the license.

### Q: Would OSI deem them "open source"?

**A:** No, it is highly unlikely the OSI would deem current OpenRAIL licenses "open source". Their core feature, use-based restrictions, directly conflicts with the OSI's Open Source Definition (OSD), particularly the prohibition against discriminating against fields of endeavor.

### Q: If so, what clauses do they violate?

**A:** OpenRAIL licenses primarily violate:

*   **OSD Clause 6 (No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor):** By prohibiting specific uses of the AI (even if harmful), these licenses restrict how the software can be applied, which the OSD forbids.
*   **Potentially OSD Clause 5 (No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups):** If use restrictions could be seen as targeting specific groups based on their potential activities.

While promoting responsible AI, the OpenRAIL method of imposing use restrictions within the license itself is fundamentally incompatible with the OSD.
